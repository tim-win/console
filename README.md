# console.py
A pythonic implementation, without dependencies, of 'please drop this to console'.

## Reasoning
I've written this enough times that it's starting to get complicated, and reliable. That's as good a time as any to pull it out of my personal projects and throw it on github with a clear license so I can start copying this into my professional projects.
